## 🧩 Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | This project utilizes TensorFlow to create and compile a neural network for handwritten digit recognition. It includes a main script `main.py` for training, testing, and running the model. The architecture focuses on neural network design and model training. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The codebase maintains a good level of quality and adheres to Python coding standards. The code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices for TensorFlow development. Consistent style and naming conventions are evident throughout the repository. |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | The project provides clear and concise documentation within the codebase. The `main.py` script includes inline comments to explain the functionality of each section. However, external documentation could be enhanced to cover setup instructions, usage examples, and overall project overview. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | Key integrations include TensorFlow for building the neural network model. External dependencies are primarily focused on machine learning and data processing libraries to support the digit recognition workflow. The project dependencies include Python and TensorFlow. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | The codebase demonstrates a moderate level of modularity, with distinct sections for data processing, model creation, training, and testing. This separation allows for easier code maintenance and potential reusability of components for other projects. Further improvements in modularity could enhance code flexibility. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | The project's efficiency and speed are primarily determined by the neural network model's complexity and training process. Optimizing hyperparameters, model architecture, and data preprocessing could enhance performance. Resource usage is typical for machine learning applications running TensorFlow models. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | Key external libraries and dependencies include Python and TensorFlow. These libraries are fundamental for building and training neural networks for digit recognition. Additional dependencies may be required for data manipulation and visualization. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | The project's scalability depends on the neural network architecture's scalability and TensorFlow's capabilities. The model's ability to handle increased data samples and digit recognition tasks can be improved through model optimization and parallel processing techniques. Scalability for increased traffic should be considered in production deployments. |
